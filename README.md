# Vault Identity and Group Management Playground

This repository provides a playground and some Terraform bootstrap code to experiment and explore identity and group management with HashiCorp Vault.

![playground-small](./img/playground-small.png)

The repository currently focuses on integration with the following authentication methods and external systems:
- AppRole
- OpenID Connect (OIDC, Keycloak container)
- LDAP (FreeIPA container)
- Kubernetes API (K3s container)
- GitHub Actions

## Prerequisites

The playground runs with either docker or podman. The prerequisites slightly differ.

### docker

Install `docker-compose`, `kubectl` and `helm` on your local machine.

Use v1 cgroups or the v1 compatibility mode on v2 systems for the FreeIPA container to work correctly, see:
* https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/fedora-31-control-group-v2
* https://github.com/freeipa/freeipa-container/issues/429

To enable v1 compatibility set the kernel parameter:
```
systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0
```

### podman

Install `podman-compose`, `containernetworking-plugins`, `kubectl` and `helm` on your local machine.


*Tested with Fedora 36*
